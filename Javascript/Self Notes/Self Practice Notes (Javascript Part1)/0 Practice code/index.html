    <h1>Learning about Prototypes</h1>
    <p>function provides an free space called prototype object</p>
    <h1>__proto__ or [[prototype]]</h1>
    <p>__proto__ or [[prototype]] both means the same, Note:the prototype is completely different than __proto__ or [[prototype]]</p>
    <p>__proto__ or [[prototype]] every object have an proto, a proto stores the reference of another object, means when an object does not have the key value required by the user then it will search in the proto</p>
    <p>In ecma script documentation the __proto__ is represented as [[prototype]] but both are same</p>
    <h1>New keyword</h1>
    <p>The three work which is done by New Keyword: </p>
    <ol>
        <li>make an this object inside the function which is called using a new keyword</li>
        <li>return this object</li>
        <li>link the __proto__ implicitly to this object , So we do not need to do it explicitly</li>
    </ol>    
    <h1>Constructor Function</h1>
    <p>Whenever we are creating a constructor function, it is a convensions that the name of the function starts with an capital letter</p>
    <p>So it benifits are colleagues to understand that, this is a constructor function, it should need to call using new keyword</p>
